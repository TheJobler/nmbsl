The goal of this survey is to prove or disprove whether or not the media has an influence in how the general public determines a pitbull from various other breeds of similar structure and size. The running theory is the stereotype placed on pitbulls is misguided, and highly exaggerated, leading to unnecessary bans and restrictions on the breed. Upon further research and analysis, this theory may be expanded to other “dangerous” breeds, established on a case by case basis, after similar misconceptions are identified.
